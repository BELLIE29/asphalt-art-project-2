# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - In my project, I used code.org to paint a pink tulip with a sky blue background. I chose to paint a tulip because tulips are my favorite flower. I love giving and recieving flowers, I love the bueaty they hold. One dream I have is when I have a house of my own one day, I will have a pretty tulip garden. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - Two things about my project I am proud of is my code and understandment. I am proud of myself for writing my code without really much help at all, and I wrote it by myself. I am also proud of how after this project, I know am confident in my understanding of how to make these asphalt paintings in code.org. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - Something I would improve is maybe increasing my creativity "levels" in this project. Something I would do differently would be instead of using the 8x8 grid, I should have done a bigger grid so I could have added two flowers instead of one. That also links to me wishing I would've increased my creativity level and believed in myself more that I was capable of doing something more complicated.
